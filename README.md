# Growth-of-Farmer-s-Market-RVisaualization

Overview:
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recognized the importance of farmers markets.Through its many programs, USDA has helped the growth of farmers markets across the country. According to the latest data from the USDA, the number of farmers markets in the United States has grown by 76 percent since 2008. There are now  8,791 markets listed in the USDA's National Farmers Market Directory — that's one market for every 38,000 people. 

Dataset:
The data is stored in “fmarket.csv”. The data file contains the following details
1. Variables indicating the geographical location of the farmers market (lat, long,street, county, state etc.)
2. Variables indicating types of products (herbs, vegetables, seafood etc.)
3. Variables indicating type of payment accepted (cash, WIC, SNAP, SFMNP etc.)
4. Variables indicating online social media presence
5. Variables indicating date and time

Project Objectives:
1. As a data analyst working for a consulting company, I have generated a detailed report on the growth and evolution of the farmers market in the US
2. Used the data to generate visual insights on the geographic, product and payment system distribution of farmers market across the country
3. The aforementioned data does not cover all the key points related to the growth of farmers market. Additional insights outside the data was included in the report
